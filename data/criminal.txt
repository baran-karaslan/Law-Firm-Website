<p>Criminal proceedings, which directly affect individual freedoms and rights, require a high level of expertise and attention. Every stage of the process—from investigation to prosecution—is closely monitored. Legal assistance is provided during statements, detention, arrest, and judicial control measures to ensure the protection of rights. Defense services are offered to individuals accused of crimes, while comprehensive support is also provided to victims and complainants. Critical steps include the evaluation of evidence, examination of expert reports, and making objections against unlawfully obtained evidence. The goal is to ensure a fair, transparent, and lawful judicial process at every stage of criminal proceedings.</p>

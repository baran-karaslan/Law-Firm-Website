<p>Residential and commercial lease agreements involve various rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants. Legal evaluations are carried out regarding eviction actions, rent determination and adjustment lawsuits, unpaid rent claims, breaches of contract, deposit disputes, and eviction declarations. Necessary legal steps are taken to safeguard either the tenant’s or the landlord’s rights depending on the situation. In particular, commercial lease disputes—especially common after the pandemic—are handled with professional legal support, including adaptation claims arising from economic fluctuations. The goal is to maintain the lease relationship fairly and lawfully without causing hardship to either party.</p>

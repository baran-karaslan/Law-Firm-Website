<p>Forest legislation is technically complex and requires specialized legal knowledge. Legal services are provided in matters involving the determination of forest boundaries, objections to forest cadastral work, procedures under Article 2/B, title cancellation and registration cases, allegations of forest occupation, and administrative penalties. Evaluations are made regarding whether properties fall within forest boundaries, the legal effects on property rights, and the status of lands that have lost their forest characteristics. Each transaction is handled using technical reports, expert examinations, and detailed legal analysis. The primary objective is to protect clients’ rights arising from forest legislation.</p>

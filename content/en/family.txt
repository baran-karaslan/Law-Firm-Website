<p>Family law is one of the most sensitive legal fields, involving both legal and emotional aspects. Comprehensive legal support is provided in matters such as dissolution of marriage, divorce proceedings, custody, alimony, material and moral compensation, division of property, liquidation of marital property regimes, protective measures, and domestic violence. Assessments are conducted with priority given to the best interests of the child, and disputes are resolved through reconciliation whenever possible. Additional support is provided in cases involving temporary alimony, restraining orders, paternity, establishment or denial of lineage, and adoption. The goal is to help family members complete legal processes lawfully and with minimal distress.</p>

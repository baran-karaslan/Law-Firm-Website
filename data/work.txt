<p>Employment relationships are heavily regulated, and disputes frequently arise between employers and employees. Comprehensive legal support is provided for drafting employment contracts, managing lawful termination processes, calculating severance and notice pay, as well as addressing issues involving overtime, annual leave, wage claims, and workplace accidents. For employers, guidance is offered on payroll management, disciplinary processes, occupational health and safety obligations, and risk assessment. For employees, all necessary legal mechanisms are pursued to prevent loss of rights. Throughout mediation and litigation processes, the aim is to ensure fair, balanced, and legally compliant employment relations.</p>
